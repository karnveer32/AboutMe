- 👋 Hi, I’m @karnveer32
- 👀 I’m interested in programming big projects and learning new things along the way!
- 🌱 I’m currently proficient in Python, Java, HTML & CSS, PHP, and SQL and hope to learn many more languages!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of all sorts. No matter how minimal or big it may be, I would love to work and participate in any project with which
I have the ability to learn and maybe teach as well.
